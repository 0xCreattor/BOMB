# BOMB

A simple bomb guessing browser game built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The idea is similar to minesweeper but lighter: pick how many bombs you want, then try to clear the board without hitting them.  
Quick to play, easy to run, and fun to test!

2. Choose how many bombs will be placed on the board (3, 5, or 10).

5. Win by avoiding all bombs ðŸŽ‰.
